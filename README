How to Install VIM Mumps toolkit by Sam Habiel

1. Put KBAWDUMP.m (from p directory) into one of your routine directories in GT.M.
2. Move the commands in the .vimrc to your .vimrc (in your home directory), or, if you wish, move the file whole, overwriting yours!
3. Move the commands in the .vim/ folder to your .vim folder (in your home directory), or alternately the whole files. Here they are:

 .vim/scripts.vim
 .vim/filetype.vim

 .vim/syntax:
 mumps.vim

 .vim/scripts:
 m-gdump.vim
 m-datetime.vim
 m-ctags.vim
 m-setpath.vim

 .vim/plugins:

4. If you wish to use ctags functionality, run m-ctags.sh with flag -w. Takes a long while to run. An example script run_m-ctags.sh is supplied for a cron job.
